# Assignment1


Model1 contains Logistic regression algorithm for classification.
Model2 in branch kds_model2 contains the Support vector machine algo for classification.

As the dataset is imbalance we have used the roc_auc score for better evaluationa nd we find that support vector machine ouperforms logistic regression model.
